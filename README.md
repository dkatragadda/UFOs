# UFOs

## Overview of the UFO Assignment
The purpose of this assignment was to use our skills with javascript, html and css to render data on a webpage by storing it in a table. We received a dataset in a javascript file which included info on UFO sightings. Our objective was to display this information on an html page and use filters to filter the dataset and display the results based on the filters.  

## Results

### Overall summary of filters available

The webpage includes all the UFO sightings that were provided to us as an input dataset. We have designed filters that can be used on the webpage to display only specific results. 

The screenshot below shows the filters that are available on the webpage. Using these filters, the data rendered on the page can be filtered and display only the relevant rows. The filters available are:
1. Date - This field can be used to filter the results based on the UFO sighting date
2. City - This field is used to filter for the city in which the sighting occured
3. State - This field can be used to filter by State
4. Country - Filter by country
5. Shape - Filter by UFO shape

### Sample of filtered results

By filtering for the city, El Cajon, the screenshot below shows the results which include 5 sightings in the city.

## Summary

As we have completed building a webpage using Javascript, HTML and CSS, we have successfully launched a webpage to display the UFO sightings results that have been collected and can be analyzed in the future. 

One draback of this design approach that we followed is that the webpage is not responsive on different screens. When you view the webpage on laptops of different screen sizes or view the page on a monitor, you will notice that the text boxes in the filter search may not be fully aligned. This can be corrected to ensure that the fields are aligned and display in a neat fashion irrespective of the device type. 

Two recommendations for further development are:

1. Enable users of the webpage to submit new UFO sightings - As users use this webpage to study different UFO sightings, it will be beneficial for us to collect info on any new sightings by the users. By creating a Submit button and collecting info on the sightings, we will be able to add to the info available with us to display on the webpage thus making our content richer.  
2. Along with making the webpage responsive as highlighted above in the drawback, if there are no results retrieved, we can provide feedback to the user with a message that no data was found for the filters that were applied. Right now, it is a blank table but a message would help the users as we have taken away the filter button and the users may not be sure if they hit the Enter key or not.
